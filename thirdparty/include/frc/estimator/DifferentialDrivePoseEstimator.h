/**
 * This class wraps an Unscented Kalman Filter to fuse latency-compensated
 * vision measurements with differential drive encoder measurements. It will
 * correct for noisy vision measurements and encoder drift. It is intended to be
 * an easy drop-in for DifferentialDriveOdometry. In fact, if you never call
 * AddVisionMeasurement(), and only call Update(), this will behave exactly the
 * same as DifferentialDriveOdometry.
 *
 * Update() should be called every robot loop (if your robot loops are faster or
 * slower than the default, then you should change the nominal delta time via
 * the constructor).
 *
 * AddVisionMeasurement() can be called as infrequently as you want; if you
 * never call it, then this class will behave like regular encoder odometry.
 *
 * Our state-space system is:
 *
 * x = [[x, y, theta]]^T in the field coordinate system.
 *
 * u = [[d_l, d_r, dtheta]]^T (robot-relative velocities) -- NB: using
 * velocities make things considerably easier, because it means that teams don't
 * have to worry about getting an accurate model. Basically, we suspect that
 * it's easier for teams to get good encoder data than it is for them to perform
 * system identification well enough to get a good model
 *
 * y = [[x, y, theta]]^T
